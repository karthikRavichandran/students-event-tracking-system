# students-event-tracking-system
A system for students who can view the critical and non-critical alerts in the form of a one-liner and a short summary. The primary reason for developing this system is to bring events pertaining to each user in various categories into a single view. The project will consist of an interactive UI (an initial design will be developed in Figma) that will developed in JAVA,  a simple database connection that stores user data, and event information (like a one-liner, summary, and raw data), and LLM-based information extraction from the different source such as Mail, Piazza discussion, Grade scope, and Spire. Since it will be difficult to get permission to assess  those APIs, we will synthesize data in those forms and emulate the scenario for our demo.
